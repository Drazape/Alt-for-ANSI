# Preview
> [!NOTE]
> Only the keys that are expected to be used are shown [^unpreserved-layer-keys/weird-layer-distro]

> [!NOTE]
> Color in tables is not supported on *GitHub*, use some other renderer (e.g. [*Apostrophe*](https://apps.gnome.org/Apostrophe/)) to view it colors that indicate the finger assigned to each key

### Base
| Shift (Right) | “ | → | Control | – | % |  |  |  | — | Control | \| | ” | Caps-Lock |

#### Top row usage
The top row is made keeping stretches in mind
- normally, you are only expected to use the keys here not available in the symbols layer
- The other keys are only meant to be used when you are using numpad/mouse, and *AltGr* ins't accessible
### Shift
| **Shift** (Right) |  |  | Control |  |  |  |  |  | ] | Control | ) |  |  |

### Symbol (AltGr)

# Unusual things
### Unusual brackets
It is assumed that your typing program automatically paires the brackets; if it doesn't, the closing keys are provided in the top row.
> [!TIP]
> Use [*Input-Remapper*](https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper)—along with [this configuration](./input-remapper-config.md) for auto-pairing
#### Closing bracket layer usage
- **Symbol**: When used together; close pair with the same modifier
- **Shift**: When used dispersed; alterate the pair with different modifiers 
### Page up and Page down in different layers[^unpreserved-layer-keys/weird-layer-distro]


[^unpreserved-layer-keys/weird-layer-distro]: This layout treats *Shift* and *AltGr* as modifiers that are assigned to a thumb on each hand instead of layer switchers; Sometimes some keys are at uncomfortable positions and thus, don't have a third key assigned to them.  
  In a typical layout, the 2nd keys would go to the 2nd layer; while in *Graphene*, if they are in the left side, they are put in the *Symbol* layer so that the alternate hand can be used so press it (for ergonomics)
